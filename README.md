# Investigating Coupon Acceptance Rates

Data analysis can be found in this [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/nadeego/coupons/blob/main/prompt.ipynb).

## Initial Conclusions drawn from a cursory investigation

### Bar Coupons
1. The acceptance rate for everyone surveyed was ~41%
2. The acceptance rate for respondents that go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 was ~54%. The acceptance rate for all others was only ~31%. 
3. If a driver has been to a bar more than once, they are more likely to accept than other respondents. However, if they have a child in the car, it correlates to a reduced likelihood of acceptance.
4. If a driver reported going to a bar more than once a month, had a passenger in the car that was not a kid *and was not employed in the farming, fishing or foresty industry, their acceptance rate was ~71%. 
5. If a driver reported going to bars more than once a month and was under the age of 30, their acceptance rate was ~72%
6. If a driver reported going go to cheap restaurants more than 4 times a month and had an income less than 50K, their acceptance rate was ~46%. This suggests income may be a strong factor in acceptance.

### Carry out & Takeway Coupons

1. The acceptance rate for everyone surveyed was ~73%.
2. Respondents with Graduate degrees had an acceptance rate of ~65%, which is slightly reduced rate from the others, ranging from ~72% to ~93%.
3. Respondents with a marital status of widowed had a response rate of ~85% which is higher than all others ranging from ~70% to ~75%. 
4. There are no participants that are widowed with a gradudate degree, so it's not possible to see if having both factors increases the acceptance rate significantly more.
5. 2PM and 6PM correlate to a higher acceptance rate. It's possible sending carryout coupons closer to dinner time correlates with higher acceptance.
6. Having children doesn't seem to appreciably change the acceptance rate compaired to all other participants.
7. Having a child passenger has a small negative impact on acceptance rate at ~69%
